# Double Int Sum | Beginner Level .Net Core Path [www.patika.dev]

Hello, everyone. In this project, For each pair of numbers taken from the screen, I tried to make an application that takes the sum of the numbers if the numbers are the same, and the square of the sum of the numbers if they are different.

## Example : 

**Input:** 2 3 1 5 2 5 3 3

**Output:** 5 6 7 36

## I wish everyone success. Thank you...
